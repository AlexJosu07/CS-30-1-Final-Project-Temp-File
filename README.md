# Endless Runner CS 30 Final Project
## Alex Josu, 2022 - 04 - 06
### Overview

Simple yet fun Endless runner based game with some similarities to the game dino, where you attempt to survive as obstacles approach you in different types and ways all so you may see how far you can get



---
### Known Issues 
- The correct original game file where my game was being built in kept crashing as I tried to open the file while also giving me errors when I would try to move just the assets folder into a new created project in a temporary repository 
- Lack of commits due to the inability to clone the repository at home because of an error that kept telling me the clone had failed as it couldn't clone with files meaning the inability to make changes forcing me to make new projects to store the changes
- During the times I attempted to commit it would not allow me as it kept giving me errors such as CR to CRLF which would not go away even after I watch video after video and forums on the problem and did what they suggest such as adding .gitignore or .gitattributes within a notepad file in the project file that would still not fix the problem
- When I tried to add files to the repository through github it say it was to large even when I would do it by manually grab different smaller files and folders



---
### Potential Enhancement 
- Sprite animations
- More engaging background that appears to be moving with you and gives the impression that you are really moving by creating a infinite scrolling background method
- More obstacles (possible enemies that are animals and spikes)
- More levels (Infinite and levels mode)
- Addition of arrow keys controls for different movements
- 2D cinemachine camera meant to follow the player as they play
- Audio sound effects (jumping, moving  and dying to name some possibilities)


---
### Notes
- Original idea had to be scrapped as to many people seemed to doing similar ideas, originally planned on creating a platform game that had the obstacles coming from the roof that you attempt to dodge as you jump on platforms higher and higher and the game becomes harder all so you could reach the top or see how high you could get (There was meant to be two modes where 1 was levels and the other was just infinite to see how long you could survive)
- Project is not yet finished but has the simple idea with some working feature in it
- Files of said so what working project with be in a different repository

### Self Evaluation 

- What went wrong and how would you do it differently next time?

Overcomplication and changing my planning too late within the project timespan, next time I should just stick with my plan even if other have similar ones and just make sure to make it my own and unique compared to them. 


- If you fell behind schedule, why? What would you do differently next time?

Bad time management paired with issues I kept trying to fix on my own instead of asking for help shortened the time I had to actually code leaving me in a state of panic as I try to finish which only lead to more problem as I was rushing and making stupid errors I had to keeping coming back to fix. Next time a proper plan with what I am going to do, what I can do, and when I am going to do it is at the top of the list of changes I need to make especially if I want to work with code in the future as a job.


- What problems did you run into that surprised you and how did you overcome them?

A big problem I faced was the placement of obstacles as I thought that it would be easy and do in only 10 - 20 mins but took hours as I kept trying to think of ways to not have to do it this way because I saw how the person sitting next to me (Ethan) code had been broken at times when he converted from windows back to mac and got me scared that all the work I would put in could be somehow broken or deleted which lead to the discovery of a way to make the obstacles( for now the spikes) generate automatically through the uses of prefabs and instiations that would pass through triggers to call the next one to be generated and a trigger that would destroy the object after it triggered it. Another problem I faced was not being able to find an complete asset folders in the unity shop I could use as most cost money and or made me either have to use a bunch of different ones I could find or mix ones that don't fit well together which lead to me trying to create my own which posed a challenge I could not overcome as it was to time consuming for me create so many different types since they always turned out bad, a problem that I overcame by sheer luck as when I went back to the asset store later on and accidentally filtered 3D assets as well found a perfect asset folder (Sunny Land) I could use for my project which saved me some time and headache of creating sprites for my project.



- If you were doing this app all over again, what do you wish you knew that you didn't?

Start simple like looking at old arcade games and finding the one I like most then take the basic idea of the game set it up and add on to it with reasonable things you can actually and need rather then what you think would be the coolest, make a plan that you can stick to and not struggle with because you spent hours trying to come up with a over complicated feature for my game I didn't even really need as even without it the game would of still been good and actually finished


- Anything else that you'd like your teacher to know and something you'd like to explain that might help you earn back grades?

Even with the likely bad mark I am probably going to get, I still enjoyed this aspect of the course and computer science relating to game coding as I could do what I wanted and had the chance to make a cool game which has really showed me the possibilities unity has to offer and reason for me to continue to learn it and create cool stuff in it with the basic knowledge I have on it now and the knowledge I will get as I watch, learn and do more projects with it. I apologize for the inefficient ability to work hard enough to finish some sort of a good game and ask you to please read the email I had sent for my asking of an extension to finish the game and get a better mark so I can pass the class and have a chance to get into UofC or MRU.
